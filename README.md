# Renaissance

A stat tracker for low-tier esports tournaments.

## Objective/Problem Statement

There is a lack of tools and apps to cater to the tier 3 or below esports tournaments. This problem was rampant around 10 years ago in traditional sports too. This promoted the use of third-party scouts to locate talent. These third-party scouts were a huge financial investment and not always reliable.

## Proposed Work

Renaissance will provide a stat tracker for these tournaments and individual players as well as their teams. We provide them with the tools they need to give relevance to the collegiate ecosystem.
